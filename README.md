# MakeBlockTextCS
Code for making letters into large Ascii blocks to accompany my blog post about same.  
Three files. XAML main page, and CS and VB code files for whichever flavor is used.   
The purpose for this is making large ascii block text that could be embedded as visual markers in code files.
